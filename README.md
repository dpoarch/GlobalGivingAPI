This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.0.

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to setup the project:

## Routes

http://localhost:4200/project-grid
```



## Task

Using the GlobalGiving API, develop a webpage that displays at least 50 projects in any manner that lets a user view, browse, or in some way filter the list.

Requirements

● Should show a minimum of 50 projects

● Can show them in any format you’d like (list, grid, map, etc.)

● Should work on the latest version of Chrome on a desktop computer with high-speed internet

● May be in any programming language or mix of languages.

● You may download and load a cached copy of the API results to allow for static site generation. You may query the API live, too.

● There are many valid ways to be successful at this.


## Deliverables

● Please provide a link to a GitHub repo with your solution, email a zip file, or a link to a website showing your submission.

● Please provide a written overview of your solution, including any instructions that we need to run it. Can be an email, Google Doc, README file in GitHub, etc. Since you are limiting yourself to 4-8 hours, feel free to denote what would be included in the “next version” if you had more time.
